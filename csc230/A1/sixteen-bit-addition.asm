; This skeleton of an assembly-language program is provided to help you
; begin with the programming task for A#1, part (c). In this and other
; files provided through the semester, you will see lines of code
; indicating "DO NOT TOUCH" sections. You are *not* to modify the
; lines within these sections. The only exceptions are for specific
; changes announced on conneX or in written permission from the course
; instructor. *** Unapproved changes could result in incorrect code
; execution during assignment evaluation, along with an assignment grade
; of zero. ****
;
; In a more positive vein, you are expected to place your code with the
; area marked "STUDENT CODE" sections.

; ==== BEGINNING OF "DO NOT TOUCH" SECTION ====
; Your task: Two sixteen bit numbers are provided in (R16,
; R17) and (R18,R19). You are to add the two numbers together;
; The final result is stored in R0, R1.
;
; For example, first number is 0x0994, and second number is
; 0xfd35. When these digits are stored in registers, we would have
;   *  0x94 in R16
;   *  0x09 in R17
;   *  0x35 in R18
;   *  0xfd in R19
; with the result of the addition being in R0 and R1
;

; ANY SIGNIFICANT IDEAS YOU FIND ON THE WEB THAT HAVE HELPED
; YOU DEVELOP YOUR SOLUTION MUST BE CITED AS A COMMENT (THAT
; IS, WHAT THE IDEA IS, PLUS THE URL).
