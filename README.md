"# repofor" 
This database will witness my learning of the application of various data structures and functions.

## Process:

The Process folder is for experiments and applications of multi-process C language.

## scanner:

scanner folder: I am trying to learn how to write a compiler. The scanner folder contains the scanner part of the compiler. Currently, it has been able to identify numbers and operators. By borrowing from the Pratt parser, it uses a bifurcated tree to store numbers reasonably. and operator. Currently has and has the ability to traverse a forked tree to compute the results of numbers stored in the forked tree. Inputs outside of numbers and operators are recognized and returned as stderr.

Currently learning: Recognize letters to assemble instructions, such as ‘print’

## mul_thread:

This file contains the application of multi-threading. In C language, the use of multi-threading to simulate the mobilization of trains at a railway station is implemented. This file involves the use of mutex locks and signals.

## csc230：
This folder contains all assignments for my csc230 course at UVIC. This is about the assembly language of ATmega2560. The time is from May to August 2023.

## pict_process：
Package required: Tkinter, PIL, pytesseract
This is an image processing tool I am editing using Python. 
Functions that have been implemented so far: crop pictures, repair pictures (remove noise, change clarity and sharpening, etc.), and extract words from pictures. 
Not yet implemented but future plans: Add the function of saving pictures. Add rotation function. Add filter function. More features to be determined.

## Amazon_scrap:
Package required: selenium, logging, bs4, pandas webdriver_manager
This is a tool I wrote using Python to crawl product information from the Amazon website. The tool can crawl data from different web pages by changing parameters.
Functions that have been implemented: Capture data and store it in CSV format.
Functions that have not yet been implemented but are planned: Create statistical charts for the captured data to intuitively understand the data.
