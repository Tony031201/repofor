"# repofor" 
This database will witness my learning of the application of various data structures and functions.

## Process:

The Process folder is for experiments and applications of multi-process C language.

## scanner:

scanner folder: I am trying to learn how to write a compiler. The scanner folder contains the scanner part of the compiler. Currently, it has been able to identify numbers and operators. By borrowing from the Pratt parser, it uses a bifurcated tree to store numbers reasonably. and operator. Currently has and has the ability to traverse a forked tree to compute the results of numbers stored in the forked tree. Inputs outside of numbers and operators are recognized and returned as stderr.

Currently learning: Recognize letters to assemble instructions, such as ‘print’

## mul_thread:

This file contains the application of multi-threading. In C language, the use of multi-threading to simulate the mobilization of trains at a railway station is implemented. This file involves the use of mutex locks and signals.

## csc230：
This folder contains all assignments for my csc230 course at uvic. This is about the assembly language of ATmega2560. The time is from May to August 2023.
